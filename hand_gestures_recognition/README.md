<h3> Project related to hand gestures detection </h3>

Main idea is simple, you just hard code 'if' statements when on one axis position of one landmark relative to a position of another landmark changes
for example if landmark 8 on axis z is higher than landmark 5 and landmarks 12,16,20 are lower than 9,13,17 respectively, that means that only one finger is raised
